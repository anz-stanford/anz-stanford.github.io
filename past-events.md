We kicked off the year with some charcoal grilling, bringing together 50+ friends for Bunnings-ish snags, great company, and the latest from Triple J. It was wonderful to see many familiar and new faces. Thanks Ollie for bringing lamingtons!

We were excited to host our friends from [Blackbird](https://www.blackbird.vc/)! Blackbird is an ANZ VC firm that invests across all areas from software to space, and was an early backer of Canva. We had a great time chatting about the ANZ entrepreneurship ecosystem and exploring how we can collaborate to support the community here at Stanford.
